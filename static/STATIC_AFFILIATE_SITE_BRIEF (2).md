## Deliverables

1. **Static site** deployed to a live URL
2. **5-10 blog posts** with real Amazon affiliate links
3. **Product cards** with proper CTAs
4. **Footer disclosure** on all pages
5. **Basic analytics** (Google Analytics or similar)

---

## Timeline

**URGENT** - Amazon audit pending. Need initial version ASAP (ideally within 1-2 weeks).

---

## Context: The Bigger Picture

This static site is a **temporary proof of legitimacy** for Amazon. The main ReviewGuide.ai product is an AI chatbot that:

1. User asks for product recommendations (e.g., "best laptop under $1000")
2. AI searches and aggregates reviews from multiple sources
3. AI recommends products with affiliate links
4. User clicks link → purchases → we earn commission

Think of this static blog as our "storefront" while the AI chatbot is our "smart sales assistant."

## Reference: Microsoft's Similar Approach

Microsoft just announced similar features:
- **Copilot Checkout:** AI shopping with in-chat purchases
- **Brand Agents:** AI assistants on merchant sites
- Results: 53% more purchases, 194% higher conversion with shopping intent

We're building the independent, affiliate-based version of this.
