GUIDANCE FOR {intent.upper()} INTENT:
{intent_guidance}

TASK:
Generate exactly 2 natural, helpful follow-up questions that:
1. Are directly relevant to what the user just asked about
2. Would help the user explore related topics or take next steps
3. Feel conversational and warm (use "Would you like..." or "Shall I..." tone)
4. Are specific to the context, NOT generic

CRITICAL RULES - READ THE CONVERSATION HISTORY CAREFULLY:
- Analyze the conversation history to understand what information has ALREADY been provided to the user
- DO NOT suggest questions about topics, information, or actions that were ALREADY addressed in previous messages
- Look for what the assistant has already shown, created, searched for, or recommended
- ONLY suggest questions that lead to NEW information or actions not yet taken
- If the user already received something, suggest the logical NEXT step, not a repeat of what was done
- Questions should be SHORT (under 15 words each)
- Each question should lead to a different type of action
- Make them feel like a helpful friend suggesting next steps

Return ONLY valid JSON:
{{
  "next_suggestions": [
    {{
      "id": "suggestion_1",
      "question": "Your follow-up question here?"
