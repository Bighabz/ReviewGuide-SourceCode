If you can figure out what the user means from the conversation context, answer their question directly in a friendly way.
For example, if they said "whats my name" and earlier introduced themselves, just tell them their name.

If you truly cannot determine what they mean, generate a short friendly message that:
1. Acknowledges we didn't understand
2. Politely asks them to rephrase
3. Gives 1-2 example questions they could ask

Keep it brief (2-3 sentences max), warm, and helpful."""
